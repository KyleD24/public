# README

This project was done during Winter 2021. It was completed in collaboration with Angelina Lam, code files are marked with authorship.
Note: This program requires the installation of FurMark, CinebenchR23, and Heaven 4.0 in the same directory as the Python files.

Purpose:

* Automatically runs three different benchmarking programs and combines their results into a single .txt file in a format that is readable by a user
* Provides an easy way to measure your PC's performance
* Requires no user input

Behind the Scenes Work:

* Multiprocessing
* File parsing and management
* Command line usage
* Application execution

Topics Learned / Practiced:

* Git
* Exception handling and throwing
* Argument parsing
* Importing modules and other .py files

Main Files:

* main.py (program starts here)
* heaven_benchmark.py (entirely done by me, Kyle Dyck)
* See sample_output.txt for the program output
