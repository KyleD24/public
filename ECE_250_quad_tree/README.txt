This is my implementation of project2 for ECE 250 taken in Fall 2020 at the University of Waterloo. 
Unless otherwise stated in comments, all program design and implementation was done by me.

This project passed 17/18 test cases 
This project passed 100% of all the memory leak test cases using Valgrind.

Students were required to implement a Quadtree data structure using a recursive approach. The following functions were required:
* insert a node with a set of attributes
* search for a node
* find minimum / maximum / total of a specified value in the Quadtree
* print node names using inorder traversal
* delete all the nodes from the tree
* return the number of nodes in the tree

The main file is:
* qttest.cpp
