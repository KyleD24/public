# README

This is my implementation of lab 1 for ECE 455 taken in Spring 2023 at the University of Waterloo. 

All program design and implementation was done by me.

Students were required to design a finite state machine (FSM) framework.

The user of the framework is able to do the following:

* define multiple states that the program can be in.
* designate one of these states as the start state.
* for each defined state, write code that runs when that state is entered, exited, and while the state is active.
* direct the framework to switch states.

The main file is "p1_main.c" and it provides an example of how a user may use the framework that is specified with "fsm.c/h".
